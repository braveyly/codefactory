The program basic mechanism is that lan hosts are scanned by ICMP tests.

About how to get the mac info of online hosts.
1)arp -a
however this method is not very efficient.
2)through the third library like winpcap
it is not deserved to do like this

The differences between windows and linux platform are :
1)ioctrl routine can supply the arp table info in linux. This is no API way to access arp table in windows.
2)the SOCK_PACKET type packet can access the phisical layer packet including arp packet in linux,
but no SOCK_PACKET type exists in windows, it has to use the third library to send/receive arp packet.
